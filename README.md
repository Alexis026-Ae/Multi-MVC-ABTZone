### Inspiration

- trello
- discord
- slack
- https://circle.so/

### Core features

- âœ… Registrations & Authentication (Devise + Devise invitable, but is quite easy to switch)
- âœ… Create Accounts (aka Teams, Organizations, Workspaces, Tenants)
- âœ… Invite Users to Account & assign role (admin, member)
- âœ… Account admin can manage account & members
- âœ… Complete test coverage
- âœ… Basic UI design

### Why route-based multitenancy?

- âœ… Easy to switch between accounts
- âœ… Keep multiple accounts open in different tabs
- âœ… No hassle configuring subdomains

For example in Trello, you can have 2 unrelated boards open in 2 tabs.

### Why deep nested routes?

Yes, this can generate an "long" url like `/accounts/344/projects/4532/tasks/24342342/edit`, but it preserves the logical **hierarchy**.

```ruby
resources :accounts do
  resources :account_users
  resources :projects do
    resources :tasks do
    end
  end
end
```

I [tried using `AccountMiddlewhare`](https://github.com/yshmarov/askvote/pull/24/files#diff-44009a2f9efdafcc7cd44e1cb5e03151a74aa760c54af5c16e2cc7095ff3b0ffR7) like JumpstartPro does, but it felt too much of an  **unconventional** approach.

### Resource assignments and references should be to Membership and not User!

ðŸš« Bad

```ruby
# models/project.rb
  belongs_to :user
```

âœ… Good

```ruby
# models/project.rb
  belongs_to :account_user
```

### Roadmap

##### Todo
- nested scaffold generator like `rails generate_nested account/project name description`
- sidebar: hide scrolls, collapsible on sm/mobile
- banning a user from an account `disabled_at:datetime`
- accept invite mechanism `status: %i[invited accepted declined disabled]`

##### Ideas
- public & private accounts; anyone can join a public account
- i18n
- gem acts_as_tenant
- integrate Trello example app?
- stripe user email required => `account.owner` would be nessesary.

##### Not planned
- Admin backend (out of scope)
- Deeper authentication integration (styling, oauth, captcha) - with the current setup it is relatively easy to swap Devise with another Auth framework
